## Expert Advisor Initialization

The OnInit() function is called during EA initialization. It sets default values for the EA parameters and displays the recommended lot size based on the account balance.

## Expert Advisor Execution

The OnTick() function is called on every tick. It calls the ScanMarketTrends() function to analyze market trends and the OpenClosePositions() function to open or close positions. The OpenClosePositions() function is called once every eight hours, as determined by the condition `TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) % 8 == 0`.

## Expert Advisor Deinitialization

The OnDeinit() function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. It can be used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks.
